<h1>WoAPi Downloads and Installation</h1>

<h2>Step 1: Download the ISO compiler</h2>
<p>WoA for Pi can be downloaded using UUP ADGuard which can be found <a href="https://uup.rg-adguard.net/">here</a> with the following settings:</p>
<p>Type: Windows (Insider Edition)</p>
<p>Version: Windows 10 Insider Preview 17134.1 (rs4_release) [arm64]</p>
<p>Language: Chose your Language of Preference</p>
<p>Edition: Windows 10 Professional</p>
<p>Type of Download: Download ISO compiler in OneClick! (unZIP -> RUN creatingISO.cmd)</p>
<p>Then click the link to the right of the selection menus that says "creatingISO_17134.1_language_arm64_Professional.zip</p>

<h2>Step 2: Starting the Compiler</h2>
<p>Unzip the archive that was downloaded and go to the directory it was extracted to. Run the file named "creatingISO.cmd"</p>
<p>It will start downloading files for compilation of an ISO. Depending on your download speed, and the speed of your computer, this may take anywhere from half an hour to two hours. Now is a great time to drink a cup of coffee or watch a movie</p>

<h2>Step 3: Extracting the WIM</h2>
<p>Open the ISO that was compiled from the compiler in WinRAR or 7Zip and go to the "sources" directory. Scroll down until you find a file named "install.wim" (this is not to be confused with boot.wim).</p>
<p>Extract that file to a folder of your chosing. We recommend putting the WIM and all other files in their own folder to keep everything simple.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Installing drivers</h2>
<p>Here comes the hard part...</p>

<h1>Why didn't we just upload the WIM?</h1>
<p>The reason why we didn't just upload the WIM to download is because that would be concidered piracy. This was the original plan but at the same time, we would rather not get sued. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause!</p>
